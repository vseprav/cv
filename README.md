## Education  

**National Forestry Engineering University, Lviv**  
**Bachelor's Degree, Engineering**  
**September 2003 – July 2008**  

I graduated with a bang from the National Forestry Engineering University with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. My time there was filled with late nights in the library, endless cups of coffee, and more group projects than I care to remember. But in the end, it all paid off – I'm now an official engineer, ready to take on the world (or at least, take on some engineering challenges).
